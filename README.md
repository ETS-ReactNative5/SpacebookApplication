# SpacebookApplication
 
Introduction:

The submission for the Mobile Applications Development coursework assignment can be found in this repository. The 'node modules' directory has been ignored by Git through the '.gitignore' file, as per best practises. A 'camelCase' structure was used to write all of the code. The 'SpacebookApplication' directory contains all of the files for the Android application. The version of npm used to develop this project is '8.0.0'. The Android application was developed and tested on a Pixel 2 (Play Store enabled) emulator running Android 7.0 (API 24). The recording for this submission will be contained within this repo, however, will not be uploaded to GitHub.

Things I learned through building this project:

1.	General UI / UX as I had to consider how well the app responded to different usecases e.g., errors from the backend

2.	Building a React Native app from scratch, using functional components & hooks (my course taught React Native using classbased components, however I already knew functional, so it made sense to me to use this instead).

Code Quality:

I am using AirBNB style guide:

I enforced this through using ESLint and prettier, which automatically detected any issues and forced me to fix these throughout the project. https://github.com/airbnb/javascript
